        <h1>Welcome to the Brotherhood</h1>
        <p>Your journey begins here.</p>
        <p><strong>Hells Angels</strong>,club for motorcyclists that was founded in California in 1948 and<br> 
            is probably the best known of the so-called “outlaw motorcycle gangs.” The club,<br> 
            which is international, has been accused of criminal activity by law enforcement officials.<br><br>

            Most Hells Angels members are white males who ride Harley-Davidson<br>
             motorcycles. Each is known by a “legal,” or official, name, which may be<br>
              a colourful nickname. Membership status is tightly controlled. Prospective<br>
               members face a long vetting and initiation process, and anyone who resigns is <br>
               required to turn in all regalia bearing the Hells Angels name or “Death Head”<br>
                insignia. Some chapters have clubhouses, but members typically gather in bars and ride out together on runs to recreational destinations.<br><br>
             
                The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was founded in Fontana, California, near San Bernardino, in 1948. “Hell’s Angels”<br>
                 was previously used as a nickname by World War II bomber crews and as the title of a Hollywood film (1930) about<br> 
                 World War I aviators. The club opened chapters in San Francisco and Oakland in 1954 and 1957, respectively, and<br>
                  expanded internationally into New Zealand in 1961. However, it was not well known to the general public until 1965,<br>
                   when Thomas C. Lynch, attorney general of California, issued a report on motorcycle gangs, including the Hells Angels,<br>
                    and their “hoodlum activities.” Critics accused Lynch of sensationalism, but his report was heavily publicized in the<br>
                     American national media. Then Hunter S. Thompson made the San Francisco Bay Area Hells Angels the subject of his<br>
                      first book, Hell’s Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga (1966). Thompson befriended many members, but the club<br>
                       ultimately turned against him and beat him. His qualified admiration of Ralph (Sonny) Barger, long-term president of<br>
                        the Oakland chapter, helped turn Barger into the club’s public face and national spokesman.<br><br>
            
                        The Hells Angels’ notoriety increased after they were hired to provide stage security for the Altamont festival, a free<br>
                         Rolling Stones concert presented at a motor speedway east of Oakland on December 6, 1969. A Hells Angels member<br>
                          was charged with murder in connection with the stabbing death of Meredith Hunter, an 18-year-old male concertgoer,<br>
                           but was later acquitted. Images of violence at the concert appeared in Gimme Shelter (1970), a widely distributed<br>
                            documentary by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin. Meanwhile, low-budget filmmakers were exploiting<br>
                             the public fascination with motorcyclists by producing numerous “biker movies,” a number of which referenced the Hells<br>
                              Angels in the title: <em>The Wild Angels (1966), Hells Angels on Wheels (1967), Hell’s Angels ’69 (1969), and Angels:<br>
                                 Hard as They Come (1971).</em><br><br>

                                 
                             The Hells Angels were always known as dangerous barroom fighters, but law enforcement officials later came to<br>
                              associate them with the manufacture and distribution of illegal drugs, especially methamphetamine. Two attempts to<br> 
                              prosecute club members under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizatons Act ended in mistrials in the early<br>
                               1980s. However, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, in its National Gang Report, has continued to characterize<br>
                                the Hells Angels as an “outlaw motorcycle gang.”

    <section id="Origins and History">
        <h2>Origins and History</h2>
          <p>The Hell’s Angels began as a small group of post-World War II veterans who shared a passion for<br>
             motorcycles. In the late 1940s, as American soldiers returned home from the war, they sought a new<br>
              sense of purpose and camaraderie, leading to the formation of the club. The group adopted the name <br>
              “Hell’s Angels” in honor of the WWII aviation units, symbolizing strength, resilience, and rebellion. The<br>
               club’s defining motto, “When We Do Right, Nobody Remembers. When We Do Wrong, Nobody<br>
                Forgets,” highlights their fearless approach to living life on their terms.<br><br></p>

        <h2>The Brotherhood and Lifestyle</h2>
        <p>The Hell’s Angels are more than just a motorcycle club; they are a tightly-knit brotherhood, united by<br>
             their shared passion for riding, living by their own code, and a commitment to freedom. Membership is<br>
              selective, with each prospective member undergoing a rigorous initiation process. The club prides itself<br>
               on its solidarity, and its members often refer to each other as "brothers." They are renowned for their<br>
                loyalty and fierce sense of community, supporting one another in both personal and collective challenges.<br><br>

            The Hell’s Angels are often seen riding custom-built Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which have become a<br>
             symbol of the club. Their logo, a skull with wings, is instantly recognizable and often worn as a badge of<br>
              honor. The distinctive "1%" patch worn by members signifies their commitment to the club’s ethos, with<br> 
              the 1% symbolizing the belief that they live outside the norms of society.<br><br>
